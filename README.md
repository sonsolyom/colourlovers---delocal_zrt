Welcome to the README section of the project!

Got the opportunity to use my skillset and tools to grind through this project.

In this coding test the following technologies has been used:
- nodejs
- express
- cors
(- axios)
- html/css
- javascript
(- cross domain - cors //chrome extension)

The application is using a node webserver on port 3000, and receives its data from an external API.
The HTML part is just a barebone, for css and javascript, where the later is dinamically inserts the responded data on the screen.

As the test asked only 10 object are being loaded as the page opened, and as the user reaches the end of the browser window, a scroll event is being fired and 10 more object will load.
You can check it on any kind of screen size as this app is responsive and built as an application of mobile-first approach should be built.

Learnt a lot through the creation and of course it could be better, but eagerly waiting as a later and higher version of myself coming back to this project and smiling -and be able to sweep thorugh on it as lightning and make some magic!

Please feel free to comment and rearrange any part of the project, would be amaizing and joyful.

Thanks for bearing with me, hope we will meet soon.
